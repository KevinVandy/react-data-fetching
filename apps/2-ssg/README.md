# Static Site Generation (SSG)

Static Site Generation means your pages are built ahead of time during the build process, creating complete HTML files that are ready to serve instantly. Think of it like meal prep - you cook everything in advance and just reheat when needed.

## How it works

1. During build time, your app fetches all necessary data
2. Complete HTML pages are generated with content already included
3. These static files are served instantly when users visit
4. No server-side processing needed for each request

## Pros

- **Lightning fast loading** - Pages load instantly since HTML is pre-built
- **Excellent SEO** - Search engines easily crawl complete HTML content
- **Cheap hosting** - Can be served from CDNs, no server required
- **High reliability** - Static files rarely fail or go down
- **Great performance** - Minimal JavaScript needed for basic functionality

## Cons

- **Build time increases** - More content = longer build times
- **Stale content** - Data is only as fresh as your last build
- **Limited dynamic features** - Can't personalize content per user easily
- **Rebuild required** - Need to rebuild entire site for content updates

## Best for

- Marketing websites and landing pages
- Blogs and documentation sites
- E-commerce product catalogs
- Portfolio and company websites
- Any site where content doesn't change frequently

## Not ideal for

- User dashboards with personalized data
- Real-time applications (chat, live updates)
- Sites with frequently changing content
- Apps requiring user authentication and dynamic content
