# Streaming (React Server Components)

Streaming means the server doesn't wait for the entire page to be done before sending it. It sends what it has ready, and then continues to send the rest in chunks as they become available, making the user experience much quicker and more responsive.

## How it works

1. Server starts sending HTML as soon as any part is ready
2. Page shell loads immediately while data is still being fetched
3. Content sections "stream in" as their data becomes available
4. Users can interact with loaded parts while other parts are still loading
5. React Server Components run on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript

## Pros

- **Perceived performance** - Users see content progressively, not all at once
- **Reduced JavaScript bundle** - Server components don't ship to the client
- **Better user experience** - Can interact with loaded sections immediately
- **Efficient data fetching** - Components fetch only the data they need
- **SEO benefits** - Search engines get complete content like SSR

## Cons

- **Complexity** - Harder to understand and debug than traditional approaches
- **Limited ecosystem** - Newer approach with fewer libraries and examples
- **Learning curve** - Developers need to think differently about client vs server
- **Caching challenges** - More complex caching strategies required
- **Framework dependency** - Currently mainly available in Next.js and similar

## Best for

- Content-heavy applications (blogs, news sites, social media)
- E-commerce sites with lots of product data
- Dashboard applications with multiple data sources
- Apps where perceived performance is crucial
- Modern projects that can adopt cutting-edge React features

## Not ideal for

- Simple static websites (use SSG instead)
- Highly interactive client-heavy apps
- Projects that need broad framework compatibility
- Teams not comfortable with bleeding-edge React features
- Apps with simple, fast data requirements
